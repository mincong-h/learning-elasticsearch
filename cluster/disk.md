## Disk Performance

Using `fio` — Flexible I/O Tester (https://github.com/axboe/fio) is an efficient way to test the disk performance.
You can find some samples here:

* [Sample FIO Commands for Block Volume Performance Tests on Linux-based Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/References/samplefiocommandslinux.htm)
* [How to use Fio (Flexible I/O Tester) to Measure Disk Performance in Linux](https://dotlayer.com/how-to-use-fio-to-measure-disk-performance-in-linux/)
* [How to Measure Disk Performance using Fio in Linux](https://linoxide.com/measure-disk-performance-fio/)

Cannot understand the options specified in the samples above? You can check the command line options and job file parameters here: <https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html>.
